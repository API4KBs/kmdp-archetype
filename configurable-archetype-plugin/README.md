Maven Plugin that extends the default Maven Archetype Plugin

https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/index.html

providing a way to invoke the "generate project from archetype" MOJO, 
passing properties from a configuration file, rather than the command line.

(As of version 3.0.1, the feature is only implemented in the dual
"generate archetype from project" MOJO. Should this feature be available
in the official plugin, this extension would become obsolete and deprecated)
